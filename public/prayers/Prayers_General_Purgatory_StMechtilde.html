<div class="prayerBodyParagraph"><span class="prayerBodyParagraphInlineBold">OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN HEAVEN,</span> I
    beseech You, O Heavenly Father, pardon the Souls in
    Purgatory, for they did not love
    You sufficiently, nor render to You all the honor which is Your due, due to You their Lord and Father, Who, by pure
    grace, have adopted them as Your children. By their sins, rather, have they driven You from their souls, where You
    none
    the less wished always to live. In reparation for these faults, I offer You the love and veneration which Your
    Incarnate
    Son showed You all during His earthly life, and I offer all the acts of penance and satisfaction which He performed
    and
    by which He effaced and atoned for the sins of men.</div>
<div class="prayerBodyParagraph"><span class="prayerBodyParagraphInlineBold">HALLOWED BE THY NAME,</span> I beg You, O
    Father Most Good, pardon the Souls in Purgatory, for
    they did not honor, always and
    fittingly, Your Holy Name, but often they took It in vain and proved unworthy of the name "Christian", by their
    lives of
    sin. In reparation for their faults, I offer to You all the honor which Your Well-Beloved Son rendered to Your Name
    by
    His words and deeds.</div>
<div class="prayerBodyParagraph"><span class="prayerBodyParagraphInlineBold">THY KINGDOM COME;</span> I pray You, Father
    Most Good, pardon the Souls in Purgatory, for they
    did not always seek or adore
    Your Kingdom with enough fervor and diligence; this Kingdom, the only place where true rest and peace reign. In
    reparation for their omissions, through indifference to do what is good, I offer You the Most Holy Desire of Your
    Son,
    by which He wished that they also might become heirs of His Kingdom.</div>
<div class="prayerBodyParagraph"><span class="prayerBodyParagraphInlineBold">THY WILL BE DONE ON EARTH AS IT IS IN
        HEAVEN;</span> I pray You, Father Most Good, pardon the
    Souls in Purgatory, for they did
    not always submit their will to Your Will. In reparation for their disobedience, I offer You the perfect conformity
    of
    the Heart, full of love, of Your Divine Son with Your Holy Will and the most profound submission which He showed in
    obeying You unto death on the Cross.</div>
<div class="prayerBodyParagraph"><span class="prayerBodyParagraphInlineBold">GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD;</span> I
    pray You, Father Most Good, pardon the Souls in
    Purgatory, for they did not always
    receive the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist with enough desire, but often without contemplation, or love, or even
    unworthily, or they neglected to receive It. In reparation for these faults, I offer You the outstanding Holiness
    and
    the great contemplation of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Divine Son, addressed to You in favor of His enemies when He
    was
    on the Cross.</div>
<div class="prayerBodyParagraph"><span class="prayerBodyParagraphInlineBold">FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES AS WE FORGIVE
        THOSE WHO TRESPASS AGAINST US;</span> I pray You,
    Father Most Good, pardon the Souls in
    Purgatory, all the faults of which they have been guilty through succumbing to the Seven Capital Sins and also in
    not
    having wished either to love or pardon their enemies. In reparation for these faults, I offer You the outstanding
    Holiness and the great contemplation of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Divine Son, addressed to You in favor of His
    enemies
    when he was on the Cross.</div>
<div class="prayerBodyParagraph"><span class="prayerBodyParagraphInlineBold">AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION;</span> I
    pray You, Father Most Good, pardon the Souls in
    Purgatory, because too often they did
    not resist temptations and the passions, but they followed the Enemy of all goodness. In reparation for all these
    sins,
    in thought, word, and deed, I offer You the glorious victory which Our Lord won against the world, as well as His
    Most
    Holy Life, His Work and Sorrows, His Suffering and His Most Cruel Death.</div>
<div class="prayerBodyParagraph"><span class="prayerBodyParagraphInlineBold">BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL;</span>
    and from all punishments through the Infinite Merits of Your Well-Beloved Son and lead us,
    as
    well as the Souls in Purgatory, into Your Kingdom of eternal glory.</div>
<div class="prayerBodyParagraph"> Amen</div>
