    <div class="prayerBodyParagraph">St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection against the
        wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him we humbly pray; and do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly
        host,
        by the power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of
        souls.</div>
