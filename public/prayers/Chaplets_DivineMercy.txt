St. Faustina’s Prayer for Sinners
O Jesus, eternal Truth, our Life, I call upon You and I beg Your mercy for poor sinners. O sweetest Heart of my Lord,
full of pity and unfathomable mercy, I plead with You for poor sinners. O Most Sacred Heart, Fount of Mercy from which
gush forth rays of inconceivable graces upon the entire human race, I beg of You light for poor sinners. O Jesus, be
mindful of Your own bitter Passion and do not permit the loss of souls redeemed at so dear a price of Your most precious
Blood. O Jesus, when I consider the great price of Your Blood, I rejoice at its immensity, for one drop alone would have
been enough for the salvation of all sinners. Although sin is an abyss of wickedness and ingratitude, the price paid for
us can never be equalled. Therefore, let every soul trust in the Passion of the Lord, and place its hope in His mercy.
God will not deny His mercy to anyone. Heaven and earth may change, but God's mercy will never be exhausted. Oh, what
immense joy burns in my heart when I contemplate Your incomprehensible goodness, O Jesus! I desire to bring all sinners
to Your feet that they may glorify Your mercy throughout endless ages (Diary of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska, 72).
<br><br>
You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world.
O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us.
<br><br>
<div class="chapletRepeat">(Repeat following 3X)</div>

O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You!

<div class="chapletStep">3. Our Father</div>

Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, Amen.

<div class="chapletStep">4. Hail Mary</div>

Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen.

<div class="chapletStep">5. The Apostles’ Creed</div>

I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was
conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was
buried; He descended into hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, and is seated at
the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there He will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the
Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the Resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. Amen.

<div class="chapletStep">6. The Eternal Father</div>

<div class="chapletStep">10. Optional Closing Prayers</div>

Eternal God, in Whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion — inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase
Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit
ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.
<br><br>
O Greatly Merciful God, Infinite Goodness, today all mankind calls out from the abyss of its misery to Your mercy — to
Your compassion, O God; and it is with its mighty voice of misery that it cries out. Gracious God, do not reject the
prayer of this earth's exiles! O Lord, Goodness beyond our understanding, Who are acquainted with our misery through and
through, and know that by our own power we cannot ascend to You, we implore You: anticipate us with Your grace and keep
on increasing Your mercy in us, that we may faithfully do Your holy will all through our life and at death's hour. Let
the omnipotence of Your mercy shield us from the darts of our salvation’s enemies, that we may with confidence, as Your
children, await Your [Son’s] final coming — that day known to You alone. And we expect to obtain everything promised us
by Jesus in spite of all our wretchedness. For Jesus is our Hope: through His merciful Heart, as through an open gate,
we pass through to Heaven (Diary, 1570).
