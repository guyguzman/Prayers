My adorable Jesus.<br>
May our feet journey together.<br>
May our hands gather in unity.<br>
May our hearts beat in unison.<br>
May our souls be in harmony.<br>
May our thoughts be as one.<br>
May our ears listen to the silence together.<br>
May our glances profoundly penetrate each other.<br>
May our lips pray together to gain mercy from the Eternal Father.
