    <div class="prayerBodyParagraph">O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended You and I detest all my sins,
        because
        I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell, but most of all because they offend you,
        my God, who are all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of
        your grace, to confess my sins, to do penance and to amend my life.</div>
