<div class="prayerBodyParagraph">Eternal Father,
    turn your merciful graze
    upon the souls suffering in Purgatory,
    who are enfolded in the
    Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus.</div>
<div class="prayerBodyParagraph">I beg you, by the sorrowful Passion
    of Jesus Your Son,
    and by all the bitterness
    with which His most sacred Soul was flooded,
    manifest Your mercy to the souls
    who are under Your just scrutiny.</div>
<div class="prayerBodyParagraph">Look upon them in no other way
    than through the Wounds of Jesus,
    Your dearly beloved Son;
    for we firmly believe that there is no
    limit to Your goodness and compassion.
    Have mercy, O Lord,
    have mercy on the Poor Souls in Purgatory.</div>
<div class="prayerBodyParagraph">
    May the souls of the faithful departed,
    through the mercy of God, rest in peace.</div>
