    <div class="prayerBodyParagraph">O Jesus, I understand that Your mercy is beyond all imagining, and therefore I ask
        You
        to make my heart so big that there will be room in it for the needs of all the souls living on the face of the
        earth. O Jesus, my love extends beyond the world, to the souls suffering in purgatory, and I want to exercise
        mercy
        toward them by means of indulgenced prayers. God’s mercy is unfathomable and inexhaustible, just as God Himself
        is
        unfathomable. Even if I were to use the strongest words there are to express this mercy of God, all this would
        be
        nothing in comparison with what it is in reality. O Jesus, make my heart sensitive to all the sufferings of my
        neighbor, whether of body or of soul. O my Jesus, I know that You act toward us as we act toward our neighbor.
        My
        Jesus, make my heart like unto Your merciful Heart. Jesus, help me to go through life doing good to everyone.
