Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.

    <div>The Apostles’ Creed</div>
</div>

I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was
conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was
buried; He descended into hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, and is seated at
the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there He will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the
Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the Resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. Amen.
