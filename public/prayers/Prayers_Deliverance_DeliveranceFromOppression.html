    <div class="prayerBodyParagraph">Most Blessed Trinity, by the authority given to me by the natural law and by You
        giving
        these things & rights to me, I exercise authority, rights and power over my N. (income, finances, possessions,
        etc.)
        and anything else that pertains to the oppression. By the merits of Your Sacred Wounds, I reclaim the rights,
        powers
        and authority over anything which I may have lost or conceded to any demon and I ask You to remove any demon's
        ability to influence or affect anything in my life. God the Father humiliate the demons that have sought to
        steal
        Your glory from You by oppressing Your creatures. We beseech You to show Your great glory and power over them
        and
        Your great generosity to me, Your unworthy creature, by answering all that I have asked of You. I bind all
        demons of
        oppression, in the name of Jesus, by the power of the Most Precious Blood, the power of the humility with which
        Christ suffered His wounds, and the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Virgin Most Powerful, Saint Michael
        the
        Archangel, the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul, and all the saints, and I command you to leave and go to the
        foot
        of the Holy Cross to receive your sentence, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
